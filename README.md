The user can view their Favorites list by clicking the button next to their search bar. From there they can view more details about each show or remove it from their list.

##Project Info
For this project I used React JS as it is a library that I've been working on in the past few months and I am more familiar with. 
It is a library that uses the Virtual DOM, which is important for our project as we want it to be fast whenever there is an update. 
Also the components logic is useful, because in the project there are many reusable components for different pages. 
Also using Redux for the state management is very convenient for storing all the states and updating them.

I also included some unit tests for the reducers used in the app.
